									<p></p>
									<p>There is nothing more frustrating than a product that is impossible to figure out. Not knowing how to get back to where you were on a website, failing time and time again to open the same door you walk through everyday on your way into work,  or an automatic faucet that requires a rain dance to get working can easily ruin a user's mood. Once I started to take notice of the everyday frustrations caused by design a few years ago, I knew I needed to learn more, and how to fix the problem. Since beginning my adventure into design I've come to believe that design starts at conception of what something will be to the symbols that show how to use it. This has lead me to study and practice a variety of areas including UX, UI and graphic design.
									</p>
									<p>I've fallen in love with the process of taking a product and giving a well defined purpose that allows the user to accomplish what they need and have a blast doing it. I love creating things that take the user on a journey of discovery, that make them smile, and most importantly, don't make them throw the product through a window.

												<h3>User Experience</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
											I believe User Experience is the heart of what makes design great. Great UX can take a seemingly mundane product like a toaster and make the process of making an Eggo waffle delightful. I've fallen in love with the process of UX design, from identifying a problem and conducting User Research to Wire Framing and creating a Prototype to put in the hands of a user. This process gives me the opportunity to tell people a story through a product and take them on a journey of discovery that provides them with a new resource they didn't have before, and can hopefully improve the way they do things everyday. </p>

												<h3>User Interface</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
											There's something so incredibly pleasing about a well done User Interface. From the accent colors of an app to the navigation buttons that guide the user around, a well done surprise can put a smile on a user's face. Practicing UI design gives me the opportunity to bring the hard work done in the UX process home by providing further clarity to the user while simultaneously giving a unique look and feel to a product. Providing this unique look and feel is what I believe makes UI special and so important to the design process.

												<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
											My first iPod was the iPod Nano, the first piece of technology I could call mine. Before this, technology had been more of a pain than a joy to use, but the iPod Nano changed all of that with one simple feature: the click wheel. For the first time in my life using a piece of technology felt as easy as turning a door knob or using a pencil; it was an extension of my hand. That iPod Nano sparked my fascination with technology. From that day forward I needed to know how it worked and was determined to create technology just like. That burning desire to create great products is what pushing me into my major and is the reason I do what I do today. </p>
