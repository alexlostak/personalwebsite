										<h2>What Excites Me</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
									I’m Alex Lostak, a Junior at the University of Texas at Austin majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a focus on Software Engineering and Entrepreneurship. I love creating things, whether it's programming an app that makes my day more productive, designing a website to bring a product to life or taking photographs to tell the story of a journey. I believe there's room for creativity in anything we do and I take that approach in everything I create. I hope this site services to demonstrate this love I have for creativity, and the joy I bring in telling a story through making things people use everyday.

												<h3>Software</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
											My first iPod was the iPod Nano, the first piece of technology I could call mine. Before this, technology had been more of a pain than a joy to use, but the iPod Nano changed all of that with one simple feature: the click wheel. For the first time in my life using a piece of technology felt as easy as turning a door knob or using a pencil; it was an extension of my hand. That iPod Nano sparked my fascination with technology. From that day forward I needed to know how it worked and was determined to create technology just like it. That burning desire to create great products is what pushing me into my major and is the reason I do what I do today. </p>

												<h3>Design</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I have always been fascinated why it is do we do things. Why is one object easy to use and another incredibly confusing? Reading about the design of doors and what makes them intuitive in "The Design of Everyday Things" showed me what excited me more than anything. From then on I've been obsessed with design. I love creating products that are well designed, from the software that runs them to the interface a user interacts with. I believe that design should be taken into consideration in every step of the development process. Great software is nothing with terrible User Experience, and there’s no point in having a beautifully designed interface if the software running a product is slow. This love for good design pushes me to create well designed products and work with those that share the same values.
