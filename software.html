									<p>I was fourteen when I first tinkered with technology, after discovering how to tear down and rebuild my iPhone 4 I fell in love with customizing every part of it with different colored displays and buttons to make it exactly how I liked. I spent the next few years running an iPhone repair and customization business I started and fell in love with everything related to technology. Once the time for applying to college came around, studying Computer Engineering seemed like it would make the perfect fit.
									</p>
									<p>Since entering college I've discovered my passion lies in creating great software. From taking classes in subjects from Data Structures to Computer Architecture as well as spending a summer doing full stack development for an Austin Web Development Startup, I've come to appreciate that great software is important on every level of a product from the high level interactions to the low level software interacting with the hardware directly. I aim to always create great software to empower people to do great things and make their everyday lives easier.
									</p>
									<p>In entering the professional field I hope to be involved in Artificial Intelligence and Smart Home technology, two areas I see vast potential in that also provide an incredible amount of excitement in the years to come. I've put a few projects I've been a part of in both school and from my internship below. Feel free to check them out and reach out if you'd like to create something great together.

					  								<!-- <i class="ion-eye"></i> -->
												<p>At the end of my sophomore year, our final project was to create an interpreter in C for the Blip programming langauge. This was a challenging project I enjoyed every moment of, and was the first large software project I completed on my own. Feel free to give it a look and try it out.</p>

												<h3>Chat Room</h3>
												<p>My first semester of my junior year we were required to create a working chat room using Java world. I developed the server for the chat room and how it would handle client messages and send them out to other users in the chat room. At the end our chat room supported both group and one to one chat.</p>

												<h3>Cube Company Website</h3>
												<p>One of the big projects I took on over the summer was creating a new website for the company I was working for. This was my first large front end web development project and I was able to not only create a light, fluid website but also give the company a new image to target the type of clients they were looking to draw in.</p>
